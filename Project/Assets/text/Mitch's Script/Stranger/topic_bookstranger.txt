	text=Supposedly there was an insane man who was claiming that he had escaped from something like this.
}
line
{

	text=I am trying to think of what he said.
}
line
{
	speaker_id=5
	text=Oh yeah! Thats right. So apparently, he escaped by creating a sundial made up of certain objects, which, under the sun, pointed to the exact time he was originally trapped.

	text=So can you remember what all the items he used were?
}
line
{
	speaker_id=5
	text=Yes, apparently he used: A piece of chalk to mark out the sundial, something to mark it on, paper is fine. And something to cause a shadow. Like a pen holder, that would be fine.
