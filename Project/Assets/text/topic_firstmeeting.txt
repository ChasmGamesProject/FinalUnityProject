	text=Ok, so you're probably wondering what's going on.. Well, essentially, we are completely trapped within this house. After we moved in, we could no longer leave, the door wouldn't open and even the windows resist our attempts to break them.

	text=Yep, the internet and phone lines aren't working either, not even mobiles.. Our plan was to wait for you and then when you opened the door we could go through, but then SOMEONE over here was being difficult and so we missed our only oppertunity!
